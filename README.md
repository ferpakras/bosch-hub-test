# Bosch Frontend Test: Bosch-hub

## Goal

Create a web application called Bosch-hub used to search users and provide a details page with user and repository information. Keep it simple and follow the requirements.


## Business Rules

For this test, you should consume the public [Github REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest/overview/endpoints-available-for-github-apps#users) in order to present the github data of a given user. 

The web app must have two pages/routes:

- <b>Search page</b>: this page should be clean, with a logo (use your creativity) and a field for the user to type a Github username in a form. When this form is submitted, the data is fetched and presented on the User page.

- <b>User page</b>: this page should display the user's fields such as name, email, bio and avatar picture. Also is necessary to list at least six user's repositories with some pieces of information, such as: repository name, description, URL, etc. If the user has more than 6 repositories, you should define a rule to display it (example: by newest, latest, shuffled, etc.)


## Stack

We <b>strongly recommend</b> using Angular to build the application. 

## Review

During the review, we will look into some basic web points. Therefore your application should be prepared to be accessible, performative, responsive, user friendly and resilient.

## Hints

* You could use third-party libraries if necessary, although our focus is to assess your skills with HTML, Javascript and CSS. 

* We will not provide any UI prototype or design.

* Fork this repository and submit your code. If you prefer you can send us a zip file with the source.

## That's it!

Happy coding!
